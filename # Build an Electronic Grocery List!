# Build an Electronic Grocery List!

#Objectives
# 1. With your partner, talk about what you would like to do with your grocery list. Start each statement with "
#    As a user, I want to ..." These are what we call "user stories."
# 2. Pseudocode with your partner. What objects, classes, and methods will you need to do each of the things you
#    identified in your user stories?
# 3. Build the outline for your code and then write driver code at the bottom (to call the method on the object)
# 4. Fill in your outline to make your grocery list!
# 5. Submit your challenge!
# 6. Refactor your solution with your partner.
# 7. Reflect on your learning and submit feedback on Feedbackinator!(http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new)
